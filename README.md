A simple web application (a simple online purchase order system) by using ASP.NET Core 2.0, which is a fictional company selling books. There are two classes of users, a customer user and an administrator user. The application allows an administrator to create records for book categories, create records for books and submit books under a book category. An administrator can also manage customer orders.
